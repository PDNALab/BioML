## Overview
Here we document how we used RFDiffusion, ProteinMPNN, AF2, and AF-CBA to generate de novo binders for the extracellular domain of CD20.

### Abbreviations

```AF-CBA``` AlpaFold2 (AF) Competitive Binding Assay

```RT``` Rituximab (6VJA)

```OF``` Ofatumumab (6Y92)

```OB``` Obinutuzumab (6Y97)

```DN``` De Novo

## Timeline

```August 24, 2024``` Kick-off event and official start of the challenge.

```September 6, 2024``` Deadline for antibody-based designs.

```September 20, 2024``` Deadline for 2nd generation designs.

```September 30, 2024``` Submission deadline.
